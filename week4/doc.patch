 <title>Usage</title>

-<p>The input and output locations for the MapReduce program are conveyed to Pig using the STORE/LOAD clauses.  
-Pig, however, does not pass this information (nor require that this information be passed) to the MapReduce program. 
-If you want to pass the input and output locations to the MapReduce program you can use the params clause or you can hardcode the locations in the MapReduce program.</p>
